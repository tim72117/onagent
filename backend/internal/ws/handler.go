// Handler upgrades HTTP connections to WebSocket sessions for the Agent

// NOT gated by the browser: any page can attempt to open a connection to
// any origin. The server is the only line of defense, so AllowedOrigins is
// enforced here rather than left to browser behavior.
//
// Auth, if configured, is the other half of that defense: it decides which
// appId a connection is allowed to act as, rather than trusting whatever
// appId the client claims in its `hello` message (see session.go — the
// server-resolved appId from here always wins over that field).
