// Package inference: WantService adapts the want orchestrator (an
// asynchronous, event-driven agent runtime with its own tool-execution loop)
// to the synchronous Service interface this platform's WebSocket hub calls.
//
// want ships with built-in tools (Bash, Browser, Edit, ...) that execute for
// real on the backend — Browser literally drives a headless Chrome instance.
// Those must never run here: this platform's tools are meant to be executed
// by the connected web page, not by the backend. WantService therefore runs
// want under a per-app agent role (agentRoleFor in agent_roles.go), whose
// tool whitelist contains only that app's own declared tools; the built-ins
// are registered in want's global registry (we can't stop that) but are
// simply never selectable by any of these roles. Selecting one of an app's
// own tools doesn't execute it either — the tool's Call implementation
// (forwardingTool, in agent_roles.go) records the call and returns
// immediately; WantService.Complete reads it back out of the shared sink
// once the run reaches "idle".
//
// want.Orchestrator has one AgentID (and one Role) per orchestrator
// instance and dispatches every Submit() onto the same activation queue,
// processing one agent run at a time. WantService therefore serializes
// Complete() calls with a mutex: concurrent requests would otherwise race
// on the same AgentID/Role and the package-level callSink, each risking
// observing the other's output — this is also what makes it safe to swap
// AgentID/Role per call (see Complete) rather than needing one orchestrator
// per app/session.
