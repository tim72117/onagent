// Package quota enforces per-user monthly prompt allowances backed by the
// subscriptions and usage_events tables (see internal/db/schema.sql).
//
// The whole design is deliberately counter-free: usage is an append-only
// ledger (usage_events), "how much has this user used this period" is a
// COUNT(*) computed at read time, and the period boundary is DERIVED from
// each user's subscriptions.started_at anchor rather than reset by a
// scheduled job. That removes the reset-boundary race a mutable running
// counter would otherwise have to guard against — see
// docs/subscription-usage-quota-design.md sections 2 and 3.
//
// Attribution key is the app_id (already carried on every inference call as
// inference.Request.AppID); a user's usage is the sum across every app they
// own, joined through apps.owner_id. Enforcement runs at two points, both
// calling Check: the WebSocket handshake (ws.Handler) to turn away a
// connection whose owner is already over, and per prompt (ws.Session.
// handlePrompt) to stop a long-lived connection from overrunning.
